          <h2>IMPORTANT CONTEXT</h2>
          <p>
            This page is a historical preview of what appeared on the Apple Vision Pro store for
            <strong>The Simulation™ Archive #1147</strong>, a free prequel experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is more of a short story-driven experience than a full gameplay-heavy release, and it is not available on other systems.
          </p>

          <h2>Description</h2>
          <div class="description-copy">
            <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
            <p>
              Attached to this message is Memory Sequence Archive #1147. (WARNING: Seizure risk level 9. Do not operate if
              prone to seizures.)
            </p>
            <p>
              This Archive simulates the full experience array of Test Subject #381-A as part of Program 867B™, led by
              Professor Ludwig. As all of us here at Sim Labs are aware, Professor Ludwig has an outlandish new theory
              purporting to remodel the fundamental nature of reality. Personally, I find his new theory dubious at best.
              Nevertheless, Professor Ludwig has demonstrated some functionality based on this new theory in his latest
              simulation, which I believe he is naming "The Simulation™" (ugh, why do we keep allowing Ludwig to name things).
            </p>
            <p>
              Professor Ludwig is requesting 11.2 gigawatt-hours of energy per day to power The Simulation™. Program 867B™ has
              already expended more energy and test subjects than all other Sim Labs programs by a significant margin. Professor
              Rupert, in particular, has been quite displeased at the disparity in resource allocation, so I cannot simply grant
              Professor Ludwig's request. We must gather additional data to assess the feasibility of The Simulation™ before I
              can allocate substantial resources towards conducting Professor Ludwig's latest experiments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Archive #1147 hardly reveals any significant revelations, though it's vital we collect all traces of information
              pertaining to The Simulation™. And this Memory Sequence Archive does contain Professor Ludwig's initial mention of
              his new theory of fundamental physics, upon which The Simulation™ is predicated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note, the test subject in this Archive was terminated rather quickly due to Ludwig clumsily loading him into
              the wrong simulation, as per usual. While many Sim Labs simulations are often extremely dangerous, which is why we
              manufacture artificial test subjects in the first place, I assure you that Memory Sequence Archives are mostly safe
              and will pose no physical risk to the user. If you are hesitant to experience this Archive because of what happened
              recently, you need not worry. The board unanimously decided to disable Professor Ludwig's so-called "Ultra Realism
              Haptic Engine™" on ethical grounds following incident #053970. Rest assured, there is very close to zero
              probability of that happening again.
            </p>
            <p>Sincerest Regards,</p>
            <p>Dr. Bernard<br />Sim Labs Director of Operations</p>
            <p>
              P.S. A delegation from the Muffin Resistance has just departed Sim Labs HQ. They have informed us that our current
              generation simulations are failing. Numerous valiant Muffin defenders are being ambushed and killed during
              previously successful military operations. I am uncertain as to what is amiss. Could the Donuts have compromised our
              technology, or have they somehow developed simulations comparable to our own? Whatever the case, the current status
              quo is untenable. We must expedite the simulation development process. I have mandated a 20% increase in
              productivity and the removal of several restrictions and regulations. It is imperative that we proceed with the
              utmost urgency.
